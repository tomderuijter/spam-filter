# spam-filter
This repository contains my work to building a spam filter classifier based on the ***raw*** [Enron email data](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/).

The rough folder structure is as follows:

```
src/          # Python source root

notebooks/    # Contains code sketches and analysis
data/         # Place holder for data
```
